Things that should be taken care of.

1. Resumes with images.
2. Resumes with no educational section.



Further Improvements

1. Some functions may be combined as they may similar input like the return_headings and return_lines.

2. Classes can be used, where each object could store one resume, thus some class attributes exclusive to each object can hold some values such as the line number of keywords so that they are not calculated again and again.
